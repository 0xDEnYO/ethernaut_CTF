//SOLUTION
//- this contract does not have a payable fallback or receive function, nevertheless it can receive ETH by selfdestruct or mining rewards
//- in this case we will write a simple attacker contract that selfdestructs and send its balance to the Force contract
//- the selfdestruct function must be called with a value > 0 so that some actual balance is sent over to the Force contract
//- afterwards, check the balance of the Force contract: await getBalance(instance)
